description: "Review pull requests and diffs in routeros-samples — the MikroTik RouterOS configuration scripts for Layer 7 filtering and multi-WAN load balancing — against the rios0rios0/guide standards, with extra weight on firewall rule order, lockout risk, and credentials extracted from real deployments. Use when reviewing a PR, a branch, or staged changes here."

# Code review — `routeros-samples`

`routeros-samples` collects production `.rsc` scripts from real RouterBOARD 750 deployments: Layer 7 content filtering with a protected bridge and web proxy, and PCC-based dual-WAN load balancing. Applying one of these files reconfigures a live router in one shot.

## When to use this skill

Use it whenever you are asked to review a pull request, a diff, a branch, or staged changes
in this repository — and before opening a pull request of your own, as a self-check. It is a
**review** skill: it produces findings, not commits.

## Source of truth

The canonical engineering standards live in the
**[rios0rios0/guide wiki](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki)**. This file is a
repo-tailored index into that guide plus the rules that only apply here. Precedence, highest
first:

1. This repository's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` —
   they describe *this* codebase and its load-bearing invariants.
2. The **rios0rios0/guide** wiki — the shared standard.
3. General language idiom.

When the guide and a general convention disagree, the guide wins. When this file and the
guide disagree, the guide wins and this file should be corrected in the same pull request.

## How to run the review

1. **Establish the range.** Resolve the default branch with
   `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (strip `refs/remotes/origin/`; fall back to `main`),
   then read the diff with `git diff <default>...HEAD` and the file list with
   `git diff <default>...HEAD --name-only`.
2. **Read whole files, not just hunks.** A hunk cannot show a layering violation, a missing
   test, or a duplicated helper. Open every changed file in full, plus the files it imports
   from the layer below.
3. **Check the change set as a unit** — not only the code. A change that alters behaviour,
   configuration, or architecture is incomplete without its changelog entry and its
   documentation update, and that omission is a finding in its own right.
4. **Map every finding to a rule.** Each finding must name the rule it breaks and link the
   guide page (or the repository file) that states it. A comment that cannot be traced to a
   rule is a suggestion, not a defect — label it as such.
5. **Report, do not rewrite.** Produce the review in the output format below. Only edit files
   when the request explicitly asks for fixes.

## What matters most in `routeros-samples`

These are the checks that catch real defects in this repository. Work through
them before the generic ones.

- **Firewall rule order is the security control.** The Layer 7 chains run accept-whitelist → reject 443 → reject 2195 → reject Layer 7 matches → reject the rest, each with ICMP network-unreachable. Inserting a rule in the wrong position silently opens or closes the whole protected segment. **Critical.**
- **A wrong rule locks the administrator out.** Any change touching the input chain, the management interface, or the bridge must keep an administrative path reachable — recovery means physical access to the device.
- **No credentials, no keys, no real public addresses.** These scripts came from real deployments: check for PPPoE usernames and passwords, wireless pre-shared keys, SNMP communities, VPN secrets, and public IP addresses before approving. A committed secret must be rotated on the device. **Critical.**
- **Interface and subnet layout is part of the design** — `ether1` WAN in, `ether2` open out, `ether3-5` bridged as the protected segment behind `Ponte de Segurança`. A change that renumbers interfaces must update the DHCP pools, the bridge, and the firewall rules together.
- **Each script states its RouterOS version and hardware** (RB750Gr2 on 6.43.8, RB750Gr3 on 6.36.1 and 6.47.10). Syntax differs across RouterOS versions — a change must say which version it was tested on, and must not silently retarget the file.
- **`AUTO-BALANCE.rsc` is a standalone script**, not a full configuration: it auto-discovers PPPoE and DHCP WANs and builds the PCC rules. It must stay idempotent — re-running it should not duplicate mangle rules.
- **PCC load balancing needs matching mangle, routing, and NAT rules.** Changing one without the others produces asymmetric routing that looks like an intermittent network fault.
- **The web proxy redirect is a policy decision** — HTTP on 80 is redirected to the on-device proxy on 8080. Removing or widening it changes what the protected segment can reach.
- **These are samples, not a managed configuration.** Keep the README's applicability notes accurate so nobody pastes a file into the wrong device.

### Commands a reviewer should be able to quote

```bash
# apply to a lab device only, never a production router
/import file-name=<script>.rsc
/export compact                    # to diff a device against a sample
```

### Dispatch tables over `switch`

See [Mapper Design Pattern](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Mapper-Design-Pattern). Two or three stable cases may stay a
`switch`. Four or more, or a set that grows with features, becomes a map from key to handler
so that adding a case is a new entry rather than an edit to the dispatcher. Flag new
`switch`/`if-else` chains that dispatch on a string or enum key.

## Tests

There is no automated tooling. Verification is importing the script onto a lab RouterBOARD of the stated model and RouterOS version, then confirming connectivity from both the open and the protected segments — and that the management path still works.

## Documentation and change control

See [Documentation & Change Control](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Documentation-&-Change-Control) and
[CHANGELOG Formatting](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/CHANGELOG-Formatting).

This repository uses **chlog fragments**. `CHANGELOG.md` is generated and is never edited by
hand.

- Every change ships a fragment created with `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "…"`, staged in
  the **same commit** as the code. Kinds: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, `Security`.
- A backward-incompatible change to the public interface additionally carries `--breaking`.
  The kind alone never triggers a major bump.
- A hand-edited `CHANGELOG.md`, or a code change with no fragment under
  `.changes/unreleased/`, is a **Critical** finding — `chlog check` fails the build for it.
- Fragment bodies start with a lowercase verb in simple past tense, capitalise proper nouns
  (GitHub, Go, Docker), and wrap code identifiers and versions in backticks.
- `README.md` is updated whenever usage, setup, configuration, or architecture changes;
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` whenever the workflow, commands, or
  structure changes. Documentation and code ship in one commit.

## Git Flow and pull-request hygiene

See [Git Flow](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Git-Flow) and [Merge Guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Merge-Guide).

- Branch names are `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `test/`, or `docs/` followed by a
  ticket ID or a short slug — `feat/TICKET-000`, `fix/input-mask`.
- Commit subjects are `type(SCOPE): message`: simple past tense (`added`, `fixed`, `changed`,
  `removed`), lowercase first word, no trailing period, code identifiers in backticks.
- Branches are synchronised with `git rebase`, never `git merge`. A merge commit from the
  default branch inside a feature branch is a finding.
- Breaking changes are flagged in **three** places: the commit footer
  (`**BREAKING CHANGE:** …`), the changelog, and the pull-request description. One or two of
  the three is not enough.
- Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/): MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for
  features, PATCH for fixes.

## Security

See [Security](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Security).

- **No hard-coded secrets.** API keys, tokens, passwords, and private keys belong in
  environment variables or a secret manager — never in source, tests, fixtures, or the
  changelog. A secret that reaches a commit must be rotated, not merely deleted.
- **Never write a PEM header sentinel or a realistic key shape into a fixture**
  (`ghp_…`, `sk-…`, `AKIA…`, `xoxb-…`, JWT-shaped strings, or the dashed `BEGIN …` banners).
  Gitleaks matches the shape, not the value, so a placeholder that merely *looks* like a
  credential fails the pipeline. Use inert placeholders such as `fixture-token-placeholder`.
- **Suppressions must be justified.** Entries in `.gitleaksignore`, `.trivyignore`,
  `.semgrepignore`, or `.codeql-false-positives` need a fingerprint, a dated comment, and a
  reason. A suppression added to silence a real finding is a Critical.
- Validate and sanitise every external input; use parameterised queries; apply least
  privilege; keep secrets out of logs.
- Dependency manifest changes are reviewed for new transitive vulnerabilities. When a fix
  exists, bump the version rather than suppressing the finding.

## What not to flag

A review that raises noise gets ignored. Do not report these:

- The Portuguese naming inside the scripts (`Ponte de Segurança`) — it matches the deployed devices.
- Differences between the three Layer 7 variants; they target different hardware and RouterOS versions on purpose.
- Anything the guide does not require and this file does not list, unless it is a genuine correctness or security defect — say so plainly and label it a Suggestion.

## Review output format

```
## Code review: <branch or PR>

### Critical (must fix before merge)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule> (<guide page or repo file>)

### Warning (should fix)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule>

### Suggestion (optional)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <improvement>

### Change-control checklist
- [ ] Changelog entry present for every behavioural change
- [ ] `README.md` updated if usage, setup, or architecture changed
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated if the workflow, commands, or structure changed
- [ ] Commit messages follow `type(SCOPE): message` in simple past tense
- [ ] Breaking changes flagged in the commit footer, the changelog, and the PR description

## Severity

| Severity       | Use for                                                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical**   | Broken dependency direction, a leaked secret, an injection or authentication flaw, a missing changelog entry, a banned mock library, a load-bearing invariant broken, a test deleted rather than fixed. |
| **Warning**    | Naming that departs from the guide, a missing test for a new branch of logic, an unexplained magic value, a stale README or instructions file, a `switch` that should be a map. |
| **Suggestion** | Readability, consistency with neighbouring modules, and performance ideas that no rule mandates.                                     |

Rank findings most severe first, and state plainly when nothing blocks the merge — an empty
Critical section is a valid, useful review.
